# About The Project

This bot is made with the intention of setting things up without configing beforehand. You can setup most of the channels. Roles ect via commands rather than hard code. There is no need for a database and its 2 commands to get started. Super simple for people that just want to run a bot with some cool features and forget about it. If you're wanting to create something more permenant i.e setting the ticket channel once then never touching it again. Let me know on discord and I'll create a custom repo for you that has your desired needs. Same with custom commands, If you want help setting them up let me know and I'll help on discord!
